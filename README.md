# RohBot Imperial to Metric Converter

A userscript for [RohBot](https://rohbot.net) that automatically finds and converts the most common imperial units to metric.

Only tested in Chrome using [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/).

### Currently supports the following conversions:
* Feet to meters
* Inches to centimeters
* That weird feet + inch notation (ex. 5'11) to meters
* Yards to meters
* Miles to kilometers
* Fahrenheit to Celsius
* Stones to kilograms
* Pounds to kilograms
* Ounces to grams
* Gallons to liters
* Miles per hour to kilometers per hour
